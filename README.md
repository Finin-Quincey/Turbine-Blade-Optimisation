# ðŸŽ¯ Turbine-Blade-Optimisation
Code for the Design Optimisation coursework assignment (Year 4 IDE) about optimising the geometry of a wind turbine blade.

The aim of this assignment was to use computational optimisation techniques to find the best geometry for the blades of a 1m diameter wind turbine. This code implements a full-factorial / latin hypercube DoE (design of experiments), along with a genetic algorithm. Both techniques make use of the same underlying object-oriented blade model. This models the wind turbine blade mathematically with an iterative solver and aerodynamic lookup tables for an S822 blade profile.

_The MATLAB version used was R2020b_
